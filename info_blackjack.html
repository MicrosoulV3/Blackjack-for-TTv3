<p><u><b>How to play Backjack</b></u>
<br /><br />
Blackjack is a very popular casino game, almost as popular as poker. Here are the rules of the game of blackjack.<br />
Just collect cards and be the closest to 21 points.<br />
The ace is worth 1 or 11 points, depending on your choice. The 10, jack, queen, and king are 10 points.<br />The other cards have their corresponding values, 5=5 points....<br />
You can decide at any time that you want to keep your hand. If you exceed 21, you automatically lose.<br />If you make 21 you have a BlackJack.<br />
The dealer has the advantage when there is a tie, so if both players have 20, the dealer wins.<br />The game is between each player and the dealer.
<br /><br />
<br />
<u><b>How to win at blackjack?</b></u>
<br /><br />
If the player exceeds 21 (busted) he must re-shuffle his first card and loses his bet.<br />
If a player has Black Jack (aces and 10, or 21 with 2 cards) he also exposes his game immediately.<br />

If the player is busted, blackjacked, or guarding his game,<br />
the dealer passes to the next player... until his own turn.<br />
The dealer turns over his first card and tries to beat the highest score.<br />
He exposes his cards, unlike the others, because they will never play again.<br />
When the dealer has finished playing, it is time to show his cards.<br />
The remaining players, show their cards one by one, and compare it to the dealer.<br />Those who beat the dealer win, the others lose their bets to the dealer.
<br />
If there is a tie between a player and the dealer, the dealer always wins the hand.
